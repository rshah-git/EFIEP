        <p>Elite performers understand that time is the only truly non-renewable resource. How you manage and leverage time determines the scale of impact you can achieve.</p>
        
        <h3>The Time Value Mindset</h3>
        <p>Think like the elite about time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time ROI:</strong> Every activity has an opportunity cost</li>
          <li><strong>Leverage vs. Labor:</strong> Focus on activities that scale</li>
          <li><strong>Energy Management:</strong> Optimize for peak performance times</li>
          <li><strong>Compound Value:</strong> Invest time in skills that appreciate</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Elite Time Audit</h3>
        <p>Track and optimize your time allocation:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Track Everything:</strong> Log activities for one week</li>
          <li><strong>Categorize Impact:</strong> High/Medium/Low value activities</li>
          <li><strong>Identify Time Drains:</strong> What adds no value?</li>
          <li><strong>Calculate Hourly Value:</strong> What is your time worth?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Strategic Prioritization</h3>
        <p>Elite prioritization frameworks:</p>
        <ul>

          <li><strong>80/20 Rule:</strong> Focus on highest-impact activities</li>
          <li><strong>Warren Buffett's 5/25 Rule:</strong> Focus only on top priorities</li>
          <li><strong>Time Blocking:</strong> Dedicate focused blocks to important work</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Saying No Strategically</h3>
        <p>Elite performers protect their time fiercely:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Default to "no" for non-essential requests</li>
          <li>Create systems and criteria for decision-making</li>
          <li>Delegate or eliminate low-value activities</li>
          <li>Batch similar activities for efficiency</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Leveraging Technology</h3>
        <p>Use tools to amplify your time:</p>
